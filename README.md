# How it works
The user is shown a increasingly challenging pattern of LED lights accompanied with musical sounds and must repeat the pattern correctly to proceed to a more challenging level. The device displays instructions (LCD Screens) for users as well as the current score and previous high scores from previous games. As users progress each level will have a longer and more challenging pattern to repeat. The addition of sounds to accompany the LED light pattern is meant to help to user recall the pattern as it gets more difficult.
